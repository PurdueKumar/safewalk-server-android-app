Program description:
--------------------------------------
This app was a class project. The layout of the app was given and we had to implement button
press functionality and connect the app with a server to retrieve and store user information.
It was the first big programing project I had undertaken and I was impressed with how the
libraries that others have made makes high level abstractions much easier.
